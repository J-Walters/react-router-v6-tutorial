index routes
    - Index routes render in the parent routes outlet at the parent route's path
    - Index routes match when a parent route matches but none of the other children match.
    - Index routes are the default child route for a parent route.
    - Index routes render when the user hasn't clicked one of the items in a navigation list yet.

search params
    - Search params are like URL params but they sit in a different position in the URL. 
    Instead of being in the normal URL segments separated by /, they are at the end after a ?. 
    You've seen them across the web like "/login?success=1" or "/shoes?brand=nike&sort=asc&sortby=price"

    - React Router makes it easy to read and manipulate the search params with useSearchParams. 
    It works a lot like React.useState() but stores and sets the state in the URL search params instead of in memory.

    ex. in invoices.js explained
        - setSearchParams() is putting the ?filter=... search params in the URL and rerendering the router.
        useSearchParams is now returning a URLSearchParams with "filter" as one of its values.
        We set the value of the input to whatever is in the filter search param (it's just like useState but in the URLSearchParams instead!)
        We filter our list of invoices based on the filter search param.

useLocation
    - returns a location that tells us information about the url
    - a location looks like this
        {
            pathname: "/invoices",
            search: "?filter=sa",
            hash: "",
            state: null,
            key: "ae4cz2j"
        }
